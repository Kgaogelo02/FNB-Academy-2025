        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <b>Mabutsi Kgaogelo Kgagara</b> — a Computer Science and Economics graduate from North-West University based in Pretoria, South Africa.</p>
        <p>This superhero app is a personal project created to showcase my front-end development skills using HTML and CSS. It's part of my ongoing journey to build intuitive, responsive, and engaging web applications.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about using technology to solve problems, streamline user experiences, and present information clearly — even when it's something as cool as superhero profiles.</p>
        <p>Technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, and a bit of creative energy to make superhero content interactive and visually appealing.</p>
